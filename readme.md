# ObjectMapper.NET Framework

The roots of the ObjectMapper .NET framework go back to the early days of .NET. At that time there was no EntityFramework or other tools for object-relational database mapping under .NET. 

ObjectMapper .NET was one of the first tools to attempt this task at the time, and still is to this day.

The use is free, but the documentation for it is not the best. A good tip is to look at the tutorials.

For easy integration into own projects, a corresponding NuGET package is maintained. It can be found at the following address: https://www.nuget.org/packages/ObjectMapper.NET.
